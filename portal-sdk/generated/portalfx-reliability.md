# Overview

Reliability of the Portal is one of the top pain points from a customers perspective.
As an extension author you have a duty to uphold your experience to the reliability bar at a minimum.

| Area          | Reliability Bar     | Telemetry Action/s                  | How is it measured? |
| ---------     | ------------------- | ------------------------            | ------------------- |
| Extension     | See Power BI        | ExtensionLoad | (# of ExtensionLoad completes / (# of ExtensionLoad completes + cancels)) * 100 |
| Blade         | See Power BI        | BladeLoaded vs BladeLoadErrored     | (( # of BladeLoaded started - # of BladeLoadErrored's) / # of BladeLoaded started) * 100 |
| Part          | See Power BI        | PartLoaded                          | (( # of PartLoaded started - # of PartLoaded canceled) / # of PartLoaded started) * 100 |

<a name="overview-extension-reliability"></a>
## Extension reliability

This is core to your customers experience, if the FX is unable to load your extension it will be unable to surface any of your experience.
Consequently your customers will be unable to manage/monitor their resources through the Portal.

<a name="overview-blade-reliability"></a>
## Blade reliability

Second to Extension reliability, Blade reliability is next level of critical reliability.
Your Blade reliability can be equated to a page loading in a website, it failing to load is a critical issue.

<a name="overview-part-reliability"></a>
## Part reliability

Parts are used throughout the portal, from a blade and dashboard perspective, if a part fails to load this results in the user potentially:

1. not being able to navigate to the a blade or the next blade
1. not seeing the critical data they expected on the dashboard
1. etc...

<a name="overview-assessing-extension-reliability"></a>
## Assessing extension reliability

There is two methods to assess your reliability:

1. Visit the IbizaFx provided PowerBi report*
1. Run Kusto queries locally to determine your numbers

    (*) To get access to the PowerBi dashboard reference the [Telemetry onboarding guide][TelemetryOnboarding], then access the following [Extension performance/reliability report][Ext-Perf/Rel-Report]

The first method is definitely the easiest way to determine your current assessment as this is maintained on a regular basis by the Fx team.
You can, if preferred, run queries locally but ensure you are using the Fx provided Kusto functions to calculate your assessment.

<a name="overview-checklist"></a>
## Checklist

There are a few items that the FX team advises all extensions to follow.

- [Configure CDN](portalfx-cdn.md)
- [Extension HomePage Caching](portalfx-extension-homepage-caching.md)
- [Persistent Caching of scripts across extension updates](portalfx-extension-persistent-caching-of-scripts.md)
- Geo-distribution, ensure you are serving your extension as close as possible to users.
The FX provides an [Extension Hosting Service](portalfx-extension-hosting-service.md) which handles Geo-distribution.
To assess your extensions performance by data center see the [Extension performance/reliability report][Ext-Perf/Rel-Report]
- Turning on [IIS compression](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc730629(v=ws.10).aspx)

### Code optimisations to improve extension reliability

<a name="overview-checklist-code-optimisations-to-improve-extension-reliability-lazy-initialization-of-data-contexts-and-view-model-factories"></a>
#### Lazy initialization of data contexts and view model factories

The setDataContext API on view model factories was designed pre-AMD support in TypeScript and slows down extension load by increasing the amount of code downloaded on extension initialization. This also increases the risk of extension load failures due to increase in network activity. By switching to the setDataContextFactory method, we reduce the amount of code downloaded to the bare minimum. And the individual data contexts are loaded if and when required (e.g. if a blade that's opened requires it).

Old code:

```javascript
this.viewModelFactories.Blades().setDataContext(new Blades.DataContext());
```

New code:

```javascript
this.viewModelFactories.Blades().setDataContextFactory<typeof Blades>(
        "./Blades/BladesArea",
        (contextModule) => var x = new contextModule.DataContext()
);
```

# Reliability Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<a name="reliability-frequently-asked-questions-faq-my-extension-is-below-the-reliability-bar-what-should-i-do"></a>
## My Extension is below the reliability bar, what should I do

Run the following [query][kusto-extension-reliability-summary]

```txt
GetExtensionFailuresSummary(ago(1d), now())
| where extension contains "Microsoft_Azure_Compute"
```

Updating the extensionName to be your extension, and increase the time range if the last 24 hours isn't sufficient.
Address the highest impacting issues, per occurence/affected users.

The query will return a summary of all the events which your extension failed to load.

| Field name        | Definition |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| extensionName     | The extension the error correlates to |
| errorState        | The type of error that occurred |
| error             | The specific error that occurred |
| Occurences        | Number of occurrences |
| AffectedUsers     | Number of affected users |
| AffectedSessions  | Number of affected sessions |
| any_sessionId     | A sample of an affected session |
| any_message       | A sample message of what would normally be returned given errorState/error |

Once you have ran the query you will be shown a list of errorStates and errors, for more greater details you can use the any_sessionId
to investigate further.

                <li>Open the dev tools network tab in your browser and try opening the extension URL appending the following query string parameter sessionId=testSessionId - this should open a blank page and all requests in the network tab should be 200 or 300 level responses (no failures).

## My Blade is below the reliability bar, what should I do

Firstly, run the following [query][kusto-blade-reliabiltiy-summary], ensure you update the extension/time range.

```txt
GetBladeFailuresSummary(ago(1d), now())
| where extension contains "Microsoft_Azure_Compute"
```

| Field name        | Definition |

| Occurences        | Number of occurrences |

| AffectedSessions  | Number of affected sessions |
| any_sessionId     | A sample of an affected session |
