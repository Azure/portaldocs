# In product feedback

Feature-based feedback surveys are used to measure customer effort score (CES) and customer value add (CVA).  Based on the Gartner model, CES is a key predictor of customer retention and a customer's increase in spending.

Customers are busy. They expect and want their interactions with your service to be easy, fast, and valuable. Use the customer effort score to ensure youâ€™re meeting their expectations and to identify new opportunities that will improve their experience.

## What&#39;s in the survey

The survey consists of two questions that are always prefixed with:

1. How difficult or easy was it...
1. How valuable was...

English strings are validated to ensure questions are formatted correctly.  Each question is then followed by a rating scale which the user must complete before submitting the feedback.  Users may also choose to provide additional comments.

## When to ask for feedback

A good design prompts for feedback immediately after the user has completed a specific task.  Prompts that are always on and within the context of multiple tasks can lead to an accurate response.

## How to ask for feedback

Use a Status Bar, Command Bar, or a Notification that prompts for feedback.  A good practice is to keep the text neutral, for example: "Send us your feedback"

## How to use the InProductFeedbackBlade (IPF)

The IPF blade is designed and optimized for use within a context pane.  The blade requires 6 parameters that will also be used for reporting:

- featureName
- surveyId
- bladeName
- extensionName
- cesQuestion
- cvaQuestion

<a name="in-product-feedback-how-to-use-the-inproductfeedbackblade-ipf-implementation-example"></a>
### Implementation Example

```typescript
const bladeName = "Your_Blade";
const extensionName = "Your_Extension";

container.openContextPane(BladeReferences.forBlade("InProductFeedbackBlade").createReference({
    parameters: {
        bladeName,
        cesQuestion: inProductFeedbackClientStrings.cesQuestion,
        cvaQuestion: inProductFeedbackClientStrings.cvaQuestion,
        extensionName,
        featureName: "Your_FeatureName",
        surveyId: "FeatureName+Date",
    },
    onClosed: (reason: BladeClosedReason) => {
        if (reason === BladeClosedReason.ChildClosedSelf) {
            container.statusBar(null);
        }
    },
}));
```
