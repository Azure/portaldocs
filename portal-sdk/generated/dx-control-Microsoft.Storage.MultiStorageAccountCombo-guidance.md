- The value for `defaultValue.prefix` is concatenated with one or more integers to generate the sequence of storage account names. For example, if `defaultValue.prefix` is **sa** and `count` is **2**, then storage account names **sa1** and **sa2** are generated. Generated storage account names are validated for uniqueness automatically.
- The storage account names are generated lexicographically based on `count`. For example, if `count` is 10, then the storage account names end with two-digit integers (01, 02, 03).
- The default value for `defaultValue.prefix` is **null**, and for `defaultValue.type` is **Premium_LRS**.
- Any type not specified in `constraints.allowedTypes` is hidden, and any type not specified in `constraints.excludedTypes` is shown. `constraints.allowedTypes` and `constraints.excludedTypes` are both optional, but can't be used simultaneously.
- In addition to generating storage account names, `count` is used to set the appropriate multiplier for the element. It supports a static value, like **2**, or a dynamic value from another element, like `[steps('step1').storageAccountCount]`. The default value is **1**.
