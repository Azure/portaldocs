 Each version of the SDK is supported for 120 days. Extensions must upgrade to a newer version of the SDK within 120 days from the release of the SDK version they are currently using as runtime backward compatibility is not supported beyond that.  

 To update your SDK use [the Azure portal extension developer CLI](https://aka.ms/portalfx/apclidoc) `ap update` command which will update your referenced NuGet packages and node modules for you.

 - Azure Portal NuGet packages and node modules are available at the new [AzurePortal Registry](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_packaging?_a=feed&feed=AzurePortal).
