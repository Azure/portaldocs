- If specified, the first non-overlapping address prefix of size `defaultValue.addressPrefixSize` is determined automatically based on the existing virtual networks in the user's subscription.
- The default value for `defaultValue.name` and `defaultValue.addressPrefixSize` is **null**.
- `constraints.minAddressPrefixSize` must be specified. Any existing virtual networks with an address space smaller than the specified value are unavailable for selection.
- `subnets` must be specified, and `constraints.minAddressPrefixSize` must be specified for each subnet.
- When creating a new virtual network, each subnet's address prefix is calculated automatically based on the virtual network's address prefix and the respective `addressPrefixSize`.
- When using an existing virtual network, any subnets smaller than the respective `constraints.minAddressPrefixSize` are unavailable for selection. Additionally, if specified, subnets that don't have at least `minAddressCount` available addresses are unavailable for selection. The default value is **0**. To ensure that the available addresses are contiguous, specify **true** for `requireContiguousAddresses`. The default value is **true**.
- Creating subnets in an existing virtual network isn't supported.
- If `options.hideExisting` is **true**, the user can't choose an existing virtual network. The default value is **false**.
