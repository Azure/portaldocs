## Understanding Localization

<a name="understanding-localization-language-detection-in-the-portal"></a>
### Language-detection in the portal

Language detection in the Azure portal works similar to how most systems in place will detect language. When the user makes a request to the Portal, the language/locale of the user is given in the request. This language is then checked against our list of supported languages. If the language is supported by the portal then it is accepted and set as the user language.

All language detection occurs by the Portal and is given to the extension at the time it is loaded. All extensions will be required to support all 19 mandatory languages.

### Language fallback

When the user's language is checked against the list of supported languages and is not supported by the portal, then we implement our language Fallback algorithm. For any given language we will try to find the best matching language that the portal supports. It is a heuristic that is open to modifications in the future if holes in the language fallback selection are found or overrides are needed.

Extensions will be given the language at the time the extension is loaded and the language will be guaranteed to be in the list of supported languages.

<a name="understanding-localization-list-of-accepted-languages"></a>
### List of accepted languages

The Azure Portal is localized in 18 languages. All extensions will be required to support all 18 mandatory languages from the language code list.

### Locale in the portal

Learn how locale can be used and set in the portal.

<a name="understanding-localization-locale-in-the-portal-concepts"></a>
#### Concepts

**Display Language**

- This is the locale string use for text in the UI.

**Format Culture**

- This is locale string used for formatting.

**Raw Locale**

- This is a string that indicates the user's desired **display language** and **format culture**.
	- It can be a single locale or two locales delimited by '.'
		- The first is the **display language**, the second is the **format culture**
			- If only one is present, the **format culture** is the same as the **display language**
		- Eg: "en-us", "fr", "en-us.fr-fr".

**Effective Locale**

- This is a string that encodes information about the **display language** and the **format culture** used within a window/iframe context.
	- The value is encoded as two locale strings delimited by a ".". Eg. "es-es.fr-fr".
	- The **display language** part of the **effective locale** must be one of the languages supported by the application. The list of supported locales is specified in *ApplicationContext.SupportedLocales*.
	- This is exposed internally as* fx.environment.effectiveLocale*.
	- This is exposed publically through the module **"MsPortalFx/Globalization"** as
		- **displayLanguage**
		- **formatCulture**

<a name="understanding-localization-locale-in-the-portal-mechanics"></a>
#### Mechanics

**Setting the Display Language and Format Culture**

- The query string parameter 'l' is used to set the **raw locale** of the page. If the query string is not present, the *AcceptLanguage* header of the request is used as the **raw locale**.
- Setting the query string parameter does not result in any persisted cookie.
- Given the **raw locale** of the request, the framework will map that to an **effective locale**. The **effective locale** is then used to set the thread culture of the server application. It is also then emitted to the client script context through fx.environment.effectiveLocale.
- The *"x-ms-effective-locale"* header is set only by AJAX requests to indicate the **effective locale** of the request. The *AcceptLanguage* header is ignored for AJAX requests.

<a name="understanding-localization-language-locale-parameters"></a>
### Language/locale parameters

The users display language and format culture are saved to User Settings.

You can access the user's current display language and format culture using the following TypeScript:

```ts

import * as Globalization from "MsPortalFx/Globalization";
var displayLanguage = Globalization.displayLanguage;
var formatCulture = Globalization.formatCulture;

```

### Localizing build

Portal Azure localization uses .NET localization as it's foundation. Please ensure that your build has .NET localization correctly setup.

<a name="understanding-localization-localizing-build-localizing-strings"></a>
#### Localizing strings

To get ready for a localized version of the API, the samples demonstrate building an extension which is localizable.

All strings are placed inside of a standard [.NET RESX file](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ekyft91f.aspx), which can be found at `ClientResources.resx`. This file contains all localizable strings in the extension. You can also add multiple resx files if desired. In the csproj file, the resx is configured with a few additional properties:

```xml
<EmbeddedResource Include="Client\ClientResources.resx">
  <Generator>PublicResXFileCodeGenerator</Generator>
  <LastGenOutput>ClientResources.Designer.cs</LastGenOutput>
  <BundleId>SamplesExtension</BundleId>
  <SubType>Designer</SubType>
</EmbeddedResource>
```

`Microsoft.PortalDefinition.targets` includes the components required to generate TypeScript classes which contain typed contents of the resx file. After building the samples extension, you will find the generated TypeScript definitions for your strings in `\Client\ClientResources.d.ts`. You should not edit this file, as it is auto-generated by the build.


<a name="understanding-localization-localizing-build-using-localized-strings"></a>
#### Using localized strings

To refer to the string in TypeScript, the module for the resource must first be imported.  This allows for static typing to ensure the requested string exists at compile time:

```ts

import * as ClientResources from "ClientResources";

...

this.subtitle(ClientResources.hubsLensTitle);
```

There are many cases where you will refer to a string directly from PDL. The compiler needs to understand which module contains the string, as well as the resource key:

```xml
<Lens Name="PartsLens"
      Title="{Resource partsLensTitle, Module=ClientResources}">
```


<a name="understanding-localization-localizing-build-formatting-strings-according-to-locale"></a>
#### Formatting strings according to locale

The [Azure Portal Globalization API Formatters](portalfx-globalization.md) enables you to easily format numbers, currencies, and dates for different cultures in JavaScript.

This is exposed publically through the module "MsPortalFx/Globalization"

```ts

import * as Globalization from "MsPortalFx/Globalization";
var displayLanguage = Globalization.displayLanguage;
var formatCulture = Globalization.formatCulture;

```

<a name="understanding-localization-number-formatter"></a>
### Number formatter
**Globalization.NumberFormat.create([options])**

```ts

import * as Globalization from "MsPortalFx/Globalization";
var number = 123456.789;

// User locale is 'de-DE'
// German uses comma as decimal separator and period for thousands
console.log(Globalization.NumberFormat.create().format(number));
// → 123.456,789

```

<a name="understanding-localization-date-formatter"></a>
### Date formatter
**Globalization.DateTimeFormat.create([options])**

```ts

import * as Globalization from "MsPortalFx/Globalization";
var date = new Date(Date.UTC(2012, 11, 20, 3, 0, 0));

// British English uses day-month-year order
// User locale is 'en-GB'
console.log(Globalization.DateTimeFormat.create().format(date));
// → "20/12/2012"

```

<a name="understanding-localization-date-formatter-testing-localization"></a>
#### Testing localization

The framework supports simple pseudo-localization of client side strings. This can be used to verify that your strings are coming from .resx files, but it doesn't verify that your localization process is setup correctly.

This can be enabled by adding the following query string parameter:

```
http://localhost:12000?l=qps-ploc
```

You can force the portal to run in a specific language. This can be used to verify that the end-to-end localization process is setup correctly for a given language. Note: you may have to clear user settings for the language to switch successfully.
```
http://localhost:12000?l=en-us
```

It may be helpful at development time to use pseudo-localization to ensure that new features are properly localized.

<a name="understanding-localization-date-formatter-marketplace"></a>
#### Marketplace

Packages submitted to the Azure Marketplace must be localized as well.  For more information, read [localization in the gallery](../../gallery-sdk/generated/index-gallery.md##gallery-item-specificiations-localization).
