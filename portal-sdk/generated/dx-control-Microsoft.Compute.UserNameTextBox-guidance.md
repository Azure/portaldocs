- If `constraints.required` is set to **true**, then the text box must have a value to validate successfully. The default value is **true**.
- `osPlatform` must be specified, and can be either **Windows** or **Linux**.
- `constraints.regex` is a JavaScript regular expression pattern. If specified, then the text box's value must match the pattern to validate successfully. The default value is **null**.
- `constraints.validationMessage` is a string to display when the text box's value fails the validation specified by `constraints.regex`. If not specified, then the text box's built-in validation messages are used. The default value is **null**.
- This element has built-in validation that is based on the value specified for `osPlatform`. The built-in validation can be used along with a custom regular expression. If a value for `constraints.regex` is specified, then both the built-in and custom validations are triggered.
