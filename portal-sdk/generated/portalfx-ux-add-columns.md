## Add more columns from Browse view ##

The number of columns that you show in Browse view can vary. By default, the portal shows **Name** and **Subscription**. We recommend also showing **Resource group** and **Location**. If you have additional columns you can show them, but keep in mind there's limited horizontal space. If you try to show too many, column headers and data will start to truncate and you may need a scroll bar at the bottom of the blade (which is something we try to avoid).

Users can always click **Columns** and add as many as they want.
