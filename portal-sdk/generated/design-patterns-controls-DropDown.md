# DropDown

 
<a name="basics"></a>
### Basics
A DropDown is a list in which the selected item is always visible, and the others are visible on demand by clicking a drop-down button.

### When to use
To select a **single option** among existing values.  Choose the control best suited to your needs
* **CheckBox** - a choice to switch between 2 mutually exclusive options (on/off, enable/disable) or to indicate a subordinate setting (I agree to terms) when paired with another control
opt in to a single choice.  For example, use a single CheckBox for "I agree" instead of a different control where the user chooses between "I agree" and "I don't agree".
* **TriStateCheckBox** - can be checked, not checked or partially checked to indicate the checked state of children items in a hierarchy.
* **DropDown** - a single choice between a large number of options.  The DropDown control is also used on a smaller set of options where the default option is recommended for most users.  The DropDown control can also be used to make multiple selections from a set of options.
* **OptionsGroup** - No longer recommended.
* **RadioButtons** - a single choice between 2-7 equally weighted options.

### Best practices
DropDowns are used to simplify the design and make a choice within the UI. When closed, only the selected item is visible. When users click the drop-down button, all the options become visible. To change the value, users open the list and click another value or use the arrow keys (up and down) to select a new value.

DropDown offers the following options:
* Grouping of items
* Filtering / Searching
* Multiselect + Select all
* HTML formatting of items

#### Do

* Use a DropDown when there are multiple choices that can be collapsed under one title. Or if the list of items is long or when space is constrained.
* Use shortened statements or single words as options.
* Use a DropDown when the selected option is more important than the alternatives (in contrast to radio buttons where all the choices are visible putting more emphasis on the other options).

#### Don&#39;t
* Don't use DropDown when there are 2-7 equally weighted options that the user needs to see, use RadioButtons instead.

### Developer tips and tricks
* For nested DropDown items, i.e. whenever header items are used, Extension developers should make use of the \`ariaLabel\` options in both [simple Item](#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Playground/F_Ctrl_DropDown_Item_I) and [Group item](#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Playground/F_Ctrl_DropDown_Group_I) APIs for all drop-down items to reference the text content of their respective item-headers.
* \`selectAll\` is not supported with disabled drop-down items.
