# Design Guidelines

These design guidelines provide solutions for common scenarios in Azure.  We formalize these best practices once several teams solve a similar problem using a well-researched approach and see successful real-world usage of the common solution. Azure teams should leverage these design guidelines to accelerate extension development and to provide users with a familiar experience so that users can easily adopt new Azure services.

## Controls design guidance
Controls are the building blocks of the Azure UX. They allow users to view, edit, and analyze data. Using built in controls provides consistency across the portal. Additionally, issues around usability, accessibility, security and any other fundamentals are handled by the Framework team.

#### Quick tips on page design
    * Pages should be full screen so that we avoid partial pages and avoid horizontal scrolling
    * Content on a page should be constrained to a maximum width of 700px
    * Each page that is displaying data should have a **Refresh** command
